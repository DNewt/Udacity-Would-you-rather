# Udacity-Would-you-rather

Project: 

Would You Rather is a game where users can post two options

'Would you rather do 'A' or 'B'' 

Users then vote and can view if they are in the majority or minority for each poll.

Users are ranked based on the amount they 'get involved' in the game, for example if they post 
questions they will get a point, they will also get points for answering
